This code is for our AI3 project which is based on an automatic sensing door. This code measures the distance using a distance sensor and opens a motor to a certain angle to open the door, while visualising a green LED. The green LED stays on unti;lthe object is no longer detected and the door stays on 3 seconds after that for safety. Once the 3 seconds are passed, it turns the door off whith reversing the motor and turns the red Led on to visualise the door closed.
